# DLL-Injector ‚Äì Educational DLL Injection Tool

## üîç Overview

This project demonstrates manual DLL injection by modifying the structure of a Windows Portable Executable (PE) file. The tool appends a new section to the target executable and embeds a specified DLL, simulating low-level techniques used in red teaming and malware analysis.

- Aligns section headers correctly in both memory and on disk.
- Low-level Windows programming using `CreateFileA`, `ReadFile`, `WriteFile`, `SetFilePointer`, etc.
- Demonstrates core concepts in reverse engineering, red-team tooling, and PE format internals.
